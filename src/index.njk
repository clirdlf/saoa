      The South Asia Open Archives (SAOA), a subset of the South Asia Materials
      Project (SAMP), creates and maintains a collection of open access
      materials for the study of South Asia. This major collaborative initiative
      is aimed at addressing the current scarcity of digital resources pertinent
      to South Asian studies and at making collections more widely accessible
      both to North American scholars and to researchers worldwide.

    The South Asia Open Archives (SAOA), a subset of the South Asia Materials
    Project (SAMP), creates and maintains a collection of open access materials
    for the study of South Asia. This major collaborative initiative is aimed at
    addressing the current scarcity of digital resources pertinent to South
    Asian studies and at making collections more widely accessible both to North
    American scholars and to researchers worldwide.

    SAOA (formerly SAMP OAI) addresses needs in all academic disciplines, from
    the humanities through the sciences. With an initial emphasis on
    colonial-era materials from South Asia, a carefully curated collection of
    resources will fill gaps in available online collections. Several criteria
    are used to select and prioritize resources for digitization, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Value to research;</li>
    <li>Utility for a broad population of users;</li>
    <li>
      Uniqueness (not available through other credible, sustainable sources);
    </li>
    <li>
      At risk â€“ due to condition, environmental or sociopolitical factors, or
      other threats;
    </li>
    <li>Complementarity to other resources.</li>
  </ul>
