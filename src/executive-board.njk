<p>The SAOA Executive Board consists of both elected and ex officio members.</p>

<p>
  Three representatives from SAOA members are elected to three year terms by the
  members of SAMP. The terms of office of these elected members are staggered,
  so that one seat on the SAOA Executive Board becomes open each year.
  Membership on the Executive Board is limited to two consecutive terms. The
  current SAMP Chairperson (ex officio) and a representative from the Center for
  Research Libraries (non-voting ex officio) are also members of the SAOA
  Executive Board.
</p>

<p>
  The Executive Board selects a Chair from among its members for a two-year
  term; reappointment is permitted.
</p>
