<h4>Purpose:</h4>

<p>
  The Content Curation Working Group solicits ideas for new SAOA content from
  scholars and librarians, conducts research on available holdings, and
  selects and prioritizes materials for Executive Board consideration,on all
  matters associated with SAOA's core mission of providing digital resources for
  open access.These include, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>consulting with other digital projects and archives for content</li>
  <li>selection of titles for inclusion</li>
  <li>approaches to copyright clearance for titles</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rationale:</h4>

<p>
  The Content Curation Working Group contributes to one of the most central
  components of SAOA: the shape of its collections.When making selection
  decisions, the work of the Content Curation Working Group is informed by two
  important documents approved by the SAOA membership:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    An evolving set of <a href="/selection-guidelines/">Selection Guidelines</a> (with expanding content foci for themes and resource types); and
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/selection-principles">SelectionPrinciples</a> (collection development guidelines).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  These two documents help focus SAOAâ€™s collection development around thematic areas
  and provide a rationale for making informed selection decisions.
</p>

<h4>Membership:</h4>

<p>
  The Content Curation Working Group is composed of at least three or more members
  from SAOA member institutions appointed by the Executive Board. At least one

  forContent CurationWorking Group members, they are encouraged to participate
  for at least two years to help ensure continuity and progress.
