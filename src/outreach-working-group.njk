</p>

<p><strong>Members of the Outreach Working Group:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>

<p>
  The charge of the Outreach Working Group is to enhance, increase, and
  diversify use of the South Asia Open Archives through community engagement.
</p>

<p>
  Our outreach is aimed at the user community writ large, encompassing both
  current and future/potential users, and member and non-member institutions
  across the globe. In furthering the open access, decolonizing mission of SAOA,
  we have a particular commitment to reaching a diversity of scholars and
  institutions in South Asia, as well as non-elite and minority-serving
  institutions in the United States.
</p>

<p>The forms of community engagement we propose include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Social Media presence and strategy:</strong>

    <ul>
      <li>Sharing information about SAOA resources and activities</li>
      <li>
        Engaging with social media content from others in South Asian studies,
        Library, or Open Access organizations
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Educational support:</strong>

        content, including

            reports)
          </li>
          <li>
            Collection introductions that frame digital holdings and/or provide
